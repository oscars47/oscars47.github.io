Inspired by Jafferis et al. 2022's simulation of quantum teleportation in this system of two of these clouds (which are dual in a gravitational system by the AdS-CFT correspondence to wormhole teleportation) but eager to address Kobrin et al.

                <p class="project-description">p-stars is a team of 12 undergraduates from Pomona College, Harvey Mudd College, and Pitzer College with the aim of classifying variable stars using unsupervised clustering. We are working primarily with the ASAS-SN catalog of variable stars, which is a collection of ~300,000 variable stars with labels, building off of my work in Fall 2022 <a href="https://github.com/oscars47/UCVS/blob/main/papers/Astro101_Final_Project_FINAL.pdf">detailed in my research report.</a> We are developing a metric for our input space of variability indices, a collection of 36 different statisitical functions designed to quantify the variation of a star's magnitude over time. Moreover, inspired by Valenzuela et al. (2018), we are building a tree structure based on the idea that one can imagine slicing a lightcurve (brightness over time) into subsequences that correspond to tokens in a large language model (LLM).

                    We are also considering the Hubble Catalog of Variables (HCV), which is a set of 84,000 unlabeled objects with much more sparse data per object in order to increase the versatility of the process. Previously my research partner Graham Hirsch and I developed a restrictive search algorithm in the summer of 2022 and <a href = "https://github.com/oscars47/UCVS/blob/main/papers/oscar_graham_summer2022.pdf" >found 2 potential tidal disruption events, </a> which if confirmed would be the first experimental observation of a black hole found in the HCV. Pomona College also operates the Table Mountain Observatory, which we can use for follow-up observations. </p>

Unfortunately the experiment was interrupted by its death. It died before it got used to having no food at all. People sell talking parrots for huge sums. They never pause to compare the possible value of a thinking parrot.".
