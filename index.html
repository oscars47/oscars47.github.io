OSCAR stands for Ocean Science Cutting-edge Anomaly Research, and the focus is developing an interpetable, differential geometric approach to real-time, energy efficient decision making in underwater autonomous vehicles. Helped co-author a grant proposal and a patent application. Currently, I have tested on the <a href = "https://go.whoi.edu/marine-mammal-sounds">Watkins Marine Mammal</a> acoustic dataset, achieving 99.3% validation accuracy and 98.7% test accuracy on distinguishing 39 different classes of mammals on a max depth 5 50 esimtator eXtreme Gradient Boosting model. In collaboration with researchers at <a href = "https://www.mbari.org/"> MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute)</a> to extend this model to other kinds of data.

The answer is k = 2*d-1 out of d^2. This question is motivated by the audacious assumption that one doesn't possess a quantum computer ready at hand but is interested in performing some algorithm or communication protocol somehow involving a bell state measurement. This extends the work of Pisenti et al. (2011), who solved d = 2^n,  and Leslie et al. (2019), who solved d = 3. A manuscript is in progress. I am also attempting to solve the odd dimension case to complete this problem.

I also ran a full simulation of the protocol as shown above for 12 qubits, 333 CNOT gates, and 171 U(3) gates, testing a variety of ansatzes for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and mu values (coupling parameter between the two black holes). The only sensible ansatz was the first (should be no mutual information at mu = 0), but the other mutual information curves do not seem to follow the general trend reported by Jafferis et al.

We focused on examining the current approaches to actual quantum computing, in which we started with linear optical conditional gates in photonic systems, then moved to photonic chips, Gaussian Boson Sampling, superconducting qubits, trapped ion qubits, topological qubits, and free electron qubits. We produced a review paper and an in depth annotated literature review, both of which are aimed at other interested advanced undergraduates.

                <p class="project-description">p-stars is a team of 12 undergraduates from Pomona College, Harvey Mudd College, and Pitzer College with the aim of classifying variable stars using unsupervised clustering. We are working primarily with the ASAS-SN catalog of variable stars, which is a collection of ~300,000 variable stars with labels, building off of my work in Fall 2022 <a href="https://github.com/oscars47/UCVS/blob/main/papers/Astro101_Final_Project_FINAL.pdf">detailed in my research report.</a> We are developing a metric for our input space of variability indices, a collection of 36 different statisitical functions designed to quantify the variation of a star's magnitude over time. Moreover, inspired by Valenzuela et al. (2018), we are building a tree structure based on the idea that one can imagine slicing a lightcurve (brightness over time) into subsequences that correspond to tokens in a large language model (LLM).

                    We are also considering the Hubble Catalog of Variables (HCV), which is a set of 84,000 unlabeled objects with much more sparse data per object in order to increase the versatility of the process. Previously my research partner Graham Hirsch and I developed a restrictive search algorithm in the summer of 2022 and <a href = "https://github.com/oscars47/UCVS/blob/main/papers/oscar_graham_summer2022.pdf" >found 2 potential tidal disruption events, </a> which if confirmed would be the first experimental observation of a black hole found in the HCV. Pomona College also operates the Table Mountain Observatory, which we can use for follow-up observations. </p>
